Arranging vaccination camps & Health awareness programmes like awareness on seasonal diseases, Nutrition for mother & child 2. AIDS awareness programmes like sending the AIDS suspected persons to nearby ART centres, developing self confidence and optimism in HIV patients, distributing broachers etc 3. Providing free medicines, artificial limbs, wheel chairs, hearing aids to the needy poor 4. Conducting community sensitization programme on Maternal Health And Perinatal Death Inquiry & Response (MAPEDIR) to decrease the Maternal deaths All these activities are done by us wiht the help of DM & HO, and local clubs in Warangal, R.R. & Nalgonda districts (B) EDUCATION: ABHAYA had run Child Labour schools & creches for children with support of Govt. funds in Warangal from 1996 to 2004. (C) Women Empowerment: As a part of thrift programmes, ABHAYA had organized 150 SHGs in Warangal. We provided vocational trainings like tailoring, embroidery, pickle making, papad making etc (D) Environmental awareness: We are participating in National Environmental Awareness Programme (NEAC) every year in rural areas comprising of 2 components: Under Awareness component, we are providing awareness on Organic farming & under Activity component, we are establishing vermi compost units, an eco friendly fertilizer production unit. (E) Legal awareness: We provided free legal guidance to farmers on Right to Information, Human Rights, Women & Child Rights etc. (F) PROJECTS: We are providing Supporting services as a Supporting Organization (SO) under Andhra Pradesh Community Based Tank Management Project (APCBTMP) & Andhra Pradesh State Irrigation Development Corporation (APSIDC) in R.R., Warangal, Nalgonda & Guntur; both of which are on going Govt. projects funded by World Bank and Govt. of India implemented by I & CAD dept. We provided Institutional strengthening and Capacity building Trainings. We have formed Raithu-Mitra groups and CIGs. Also arranged agriculture demonstrations on new technological basis, Exposure visits & promoted Agriculural Livelihood Supporting Services (ALSS) activities. MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS: In villages where we are organising Health awareness programmes the people are now well aware of vaccinations and the no. of beneficiaries are increasing by 10 to 15 % every year. We feel we had a great achievement by the response of these beneficiaries. It is because of our project MAPEDIR and the benefits provided by the Govt. that allmost all the pregnant women are encouraged Institutional deliveries. We organized 150 SHGs which are now merged into IKP. Among these, about 20 groups had established own tailoring shops & most of these women are earnings their Livelihood on Dairy etc. We are the first to organize Environmental Awareness programmes for Water Users Associations (WUA), Farmers Associations (FA) & farmers. Women were given least priority in all circumstances in Rural areas above cited programmes. But now we made them actively participate equivalent to men in project activities by incorporating them as members in WUA & FA giving gender importance. Though WUAs were established in most of the villages, the members were not aware of their Roles & Reponsibilities. We provided the necesary trainings and orientations on Societies functioning and awared them on their Roles & Responsibilities. We also facilitated them in arranging WUA/ FA offices in their respective villages and collection of corpus fund. This corpus fund helps them to face or overcome minor problems in future without seeking for Govt. help. We also trained them in Book keeping. Now for every WUA/FA, Corpus fund exists in Banks of not less than Rs. 40,000 /-. We facilitated them in identifying & appointing para workers & Crew members provided with the necessary trainings which further resulted in the promotion of their Livelihood. Also we facilitated the Crew members in taking Insurance policies. In the Project APCBTMP, we made the Ayacutdars donate their land worth of 1.2 to 1.5 lakhs for the construction of path towards their Tanks. The tank by name ""Pedda cheruvu"" of Uddamarri village in which we re working as an S.O. under APCBTMP was published as a successful story in a website.","Hyderabad",9949502692,"yrs_abhaya@rediffmail.com",,"Plot No. 33, Road No. 10, New Gayathri nagar Colony, P.O.

Unique services by APMAS for strengthening the SHG Movement APMAS core business is building capacities of the Self Help Promoting Agencies (SHPAs) through Quality Assessment (rating), Quality Enhancement, Research & Advocacy and Livelihoods Promotion Services to SHGs and SHG Federations through their promoters. Quality Enhancement Capacity Building (CB) to the primary, secondary, and tertiary stakeholders in the SHG movement holds the key for long-term sustainability of both SHGs and their federations. Various capacity-building initiatives taken up by APMAS in Andhra Pradesh and the other states have brought greater recognition to APMAS in the country. CB focuses on training of trainers based on needs assessment, hand-holding support, follow-up of training conducted, facilitating exposure visits, material development and enabling the process of problem solving at the field level. Field visits are undertaken to provide on-the-job support and to demonstrate good practices in the filed. The key initiatives under this unit are expansion of the SHG support services to the other states and promotion of the urban SHG movement. Over the past 8 years, APMAS has trained more than 80,000 professionals and SHG federation representatives. Quality Assessment (Ratings) Rating of SHG federations contributes to their sustainability. Through six rating tools that have been designed by APMAS over the last 8 years, it has assessed 434 SHG federations of various promoting Organizations. The findings of the assessments have been disseminated widely to gather consensus on the need of building necessary systems and processes in order to make the SHG federations institutionally and financially sustainable. APMAS ratings have been extensively used by SHPIs to improve the quality of their functioning, and assisting their efforts to acquire â€œseed capitalâ€ from externally funded projects. APMAS is recognized as a specialized agency for SHG federation rating in India. Livelihood promotion APMAS strategically chooses to support different livelihood interventions by strengthening the role of community based organisations (CBOs) in leading their livelihoods sustainably. Thus, APMAS created its niche role in supporting different livelihood activities across different sectors, with an approach denoted through a connotation Sustainable institutions for sustainable livelihoods. APMAS initiated its interventions in supporting Livelihood Promotional activities as an integrated unit established within the organisation in 2004. This was done with the financial support from the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF), under its Sustainable Community-based Approaches for Livelihood Enhancement (SCALE) project funded by the European Union (EU). Through this unit, APMAS plays a catalytic role in promoting rural livelihoods in collaboration with Government of Andhra Pradesh and other livelihood promotion supporting organizations. The key objectives of this unit is to integrate livelihood promotion initiatives by synergizing with the Institution Building, Capacity building processes among CBOs and thus develop these institutions to lead their livelihood activities in farm, off-farm, non-farm and service sectors with which they get associated, in rural India. APMAS provides professional support services to District/ Cluster Livelihood Resource Centers (D/CLRCs) in Adilabad and Kadapa districts to nurture and made them model institutions by creating institutional linkages for livelihood enhancement. It also provides support services in terms of IB, CB and Livelihood Promotional activities for SHGs and their federations under Indira Kranthi Patham (IKP). As part of its initiatives, it conducts few action research studies, develops few demonstrations, provides handholding support and develop case studies out of the best practices. It also organizes events like workshops, immersion programs, flagship programs etc., in facilitating the cross learning process across different stakeholders. Research and Advocacy As a resource organization, APMAS keeps track of the ground realities to provide a wealth of resources to other stakeholders in the development sector. The Research and Advocacy unit is divided into three components: Research, advocacy and communications. Action and applied research is being conducted by the unit on various issues as they emerge and findings from the studies are then used to design capacity building strategies for SHGs, promoting institutions, dissemination of findings through various workshops (advocacy), and made available to the public, through APMAS websites, and publications. Enable To build the profile of SHG movement, to bring issues of SHG movement to the notice of the government and other key stakeholders and to obtain a favorable environment for the healthy growth and sustainability of SHG movement, a National Network Enabling Self Help Movement (Enable) has emerged in 2007 with a vision â€œVibrant Women SHG Movement in Indiaâ€. Currently the network has seven member organizations, viz., APMAS, Hyderabad/Andhra Pradesh; Cmf, Jaipur/Rajasthan; Chaitanya, Rajgurunagar/Maharashtra; GMO, Kolar/Karnataka; ISMW, Ahemadabad; Reach India, Kolkatta; and SHGPF, Kolkatta. Enable is to contribute to a conducive-policy environment through research based advocacy for SHGs and federations, to facilitate the flow of funds for SHG & Federation promotion and on lending, to increase cadre of human resources using standardized training and resource materials for improving quality, to build the profile of the community cased microfinance model, and to promote innovative models for up-scaling and replication. Expansion Programme APMAS is working in 8 states Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and began to extend its operations in states like Assam, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Orissa, in a phased manner. The states were decided upon with three considerations: firstly, the state would have shown considerable improvement in the quality of the SHG movement. Secondly, the state where institution like APMAS already exists and would show willingness to partner with APMAS; and thirdly, the state where APMAS has already done some work and has some understanding with the local organizations. APMAS explored the possibilities of receiving support from different agencies and succeeded in getting initial support from Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT) for the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, from Mission Shakti for the state of Orissa, and from AKF (for AKRSP) for the states of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. It was decided to explore other collaborators as well within the states. Swayam Niyantrana Udhyamam (SNU) / Self Regulation of SHGs and SHG Federations APMAS is currently engaged in piloting a Swayam Niyantrana Udyamam (SNU) project, with the funding support of DGRV, Germany. The pilot project is being implemented in the Kamareddy Cluster of Nizamabad district of Andhra Pradesh.

Urban Interventions APMAS has been collaborating with MEPMA to continue support in strengthening of SHGs and SHG federations to achieve sustainability. Under the programme APMAS has been developing 3 Town-Level-Federations (TLFs) in LB Nagar, Gudivada, and Guntakal urban areas. The total number of SHGs in three towns are 6029 and Slum Level Federations has reached 155 in 2008-09.

We believe this plays a vital role in empowering individual women who get educated of their human and legal rights with practical guidance on how to obtain justice. A range of women have sought support over the years. Our counseling and legal services are not advertised; yet each year at least 50 women take advantage of these services, learning about them by word-of-mouth. Gender and Development for NGO Women Leaders: Notwithstanding the output of work that women NGO leaders do at the local level and the understanding they have of local issues, an analysis of the deeper connections between the various changes going on in their environment is a welcome addition to their skills. Since the capacity building workshops that we conduct regularly were always full and there was always a rush to attend them, Asmita offers a year long distance cum contact programme, attended every month by representatives from different organisations across the state. Now Gender, Development and Human Rights Course - Year 3 is on. The range of the course is vast and comprehensive - all human rights, linkages to issues such as development, health, globalization, discrimination and violence against women. Women and Disability Rights: To strengthen the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we in collaboration with Chaitanya Vikalanguala Hakkula Vedika, Mahbubnagar, Andhra Pradesh initiated the workshops and campaigns on Disability Rights. Women and girls with disabilities face all types of discrimination. These workshops will help to support the growth and empowerment of women. Thematic Areas of the project is initiating discussion on disability - its causes, consequences and way forward; introducing the Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995; Gender Equality - - Patriarchy, Sexuality, Reproduction, Violence; Division of labour - gender, disability, age; Child Rights â€“ Violence against girl child with disability at home and outside, child health, child marriage; Poverty and Disability; The feedback of the workshops is positive, the participants expressed that they got awareness on social context of disability and enhance respect and concern for persons with disabilities. Arts and Culture: Using arts and culture as a method of outreach and awareness has proven to be a great way of disseminating our messages to a wide audience. Through Telugu and English films, publications and Indian classical dance performances we have managed to further strengthen our conversations around equality.","Secunderabad",,"asmita.collective@gmail.com","040-27733745","10-3-96, Plot 283, 4th Floor, Street 6 Teachersâ€™ Colony, East Marredpally Secunderabad - 500 026 Andhra Pradesh, India","040-27733251","Any Other",,,,,"http://www.asmitacollective.in"

The meeting was addressed by Senior Civil Advocate Jaya pradha , Hiyath nagsar Some of the local gentlemen attended the programme and addressed about all the right of women. All the Trust members took active participation in this program. They were enabled to work out strategy for effectively preventing crime against women and to evolve strategy for networking among different agencies for combating crime against women. In the Present days so of the poor and middle clears people are becoming and attracted towards intoxication with drugs, alcoholic drinks, and other stuffs like Ganja, Booting, Brown sugar, heroinet marphiya and pethe drire. When the poor and especially the youth (boys and girls) attracted towards drugs as they get them at cheaper price. Even in the richer people keep up the false prestige and culture they were pulled to the den of darkness and dip them in intoxication by some evil minded people for their personal benefits and destroy the innocent people. Due to this intoxication thousands and lakhs of crored pathies and lakhpathies have fallen on roads. At this stage we can simply imagine the condition of poor people who earn on daily wages and how their families are suffering. Daily we are hearing and reading about the suicide only due to financial problems. To educate the innocent poor people and the youth we are regularly conducting counseling in the slum are as and industrial labour colonies for the prevention of alcoholism and drug abuse we have appointed five councilors whose job is to go round the detailed areas and canvas for the prevention of alcoholism and drug abuse. Our Mahila Mandali has also taken up the process of bringing awareness to Self Help Groups through financial institutions. There has been a good response from the Self Help Groups. An awareness camp has been held to educate the loaning habits of the groups and its systems. This year we have conducted meetings and door to door visits by our women volunteers to educate the poor women who are living below the poverty line and encourage them for small savings by forming small groups for benefit and their emergency need. Each group will consists of ten to fifteen members and elect two group leaders among them for maintains, bank transaction and monthly collection. Each group members meet once in a month and decide the member who needs the loan the in that months. The group leaders will take responsibility of recovery of the in small regular instatements with reasonable interest. . This programme has involved women members in the village and they were given training in food processing, packing and storage aspects. Those women were also given information on the economic aspects of this programme and the importance and the place of food processing and packing . They were also information that they can avail loan facility from banks, if they up this activity on a commercial base. We have formed the weaker section of the village into Self Help Groups. They have been trained in savings and credit management so that they will enable themselves into self reliant and self-supportive. They will get an opportunity to get leans form their own group saving at low interest , so that they will be free from the clutches of moneylenders. They are trained in leadership and maintaining proper accounting system. They have been developed linkages with banks so that they can increase their living standards with mutual trust and away from depending on others. We have arranged a short-stay home for girls and women who face the family problems and come out for resettlement. The home can accommodate thirty beneficiaries. We have arranged for under going skilled training in different skills at their own cost. At this home we provide free stay, health care, security and guidance for resettlement. During the year eighty-seven women were be benefited by incoming and out gone beneficiaries.

We associate working with down trodden communitiesâ€™ dalit/indigenous communities across Puthalapattu, Penumur, Gangadara Nellore, Sri Rangarajapuram Mandals. Our intervention among the Dalit and Tribal people welfare program has turned out to bring results which have become an issue and we are getting calls from other caste hamlets and those not or adopt them into our program. This is in relation to children issued bicycles that leading to children putting effort in their studies and scoring good mark is one and another is women helped for their hand skill turning out broom sticks from thatch, additionally women were given working capital support to 200 women and plastic handle making plastic injection molding machines 5 no which has led to women finding enough income generation is another issue among other communities.

It seeks to build progressive and self reliant rural communities, adopting a holistic approach. Since inception in July 2001, the Foundation has been relentlessly addressing rural needs and running numerous services in Healthcare, Sanitation, Safe Drinking Water, Education, Disability Rehabilitation and Empowerment, Adult Literacy, Women Empowerment and providing training in Livelihood skills for both men and women. It also has technology driven programs like community media projects, Tele Medicine, and Virtual Agri advice through its Aswini (Virtual Delivery of Services) platform. It is the first not for profit organization to adopt six sigma as the core management framework for designing new processes and making breakthrough improvements to existing processes. Six-Sigma focuses on customer (beneficiary) centricity, process orientation, metrics and continuous improvement. The large volume of the Foundations operations lends itself to the Six Sigma way of working. The challenge at all times however, is to keep it simple and demystified so that ultimately the rural communities may themselves be able to use these modern and useful techniques. As of today, it runs more than 40 major programmes in each of the 200 adopted villages spread across East Godavari, Guntur, Krishna, Ranga Reddy, Visakhapatnam and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh, impacting 3 million rural lives. Application of the best management practices, technology and constant innovation are its key differentiators. Its mission is to create the largest global platform for holistic and sustainable rural transformation comprising many like minded partners and processes that are innovatively designed combining global best practices, effective management systems and state of the art technology. It measures over 1800 real-time metrics for effective monitoring of its rural transformation programs.","Secunderabad",9866887010,"mail@byrrajufoundation.org","040-23191726","Byrraju Foundation, Jeedimetla Village, N.H. 7, Secunderabad.","040-23191725","Agriculture, Children, Differently Abled, Drinking Water, Education & Literacy, Health & Family Welfare, HIV/AIDS, Information & Communication Technology, Rural Development & Poverty Alleviation, Vocational Training, Women's Development & Empowerment",,,,,"http://www.byrrajufoundation.org"

The CAMP initiative was started in Ponnur, Guntur District in 1990, by a team of committed individuals drawn together by their concern for the deplorable conditions of Tribalâ€™s & fisher folk residing along the seacoast in forest areas of Guntur district. Today CAMP has done commendable work in its fifteen odd years of existence, and has expanded its activities both in terms of geographical and functional areas. The organization has also remained loyal to its initial target group, the fisher folk, and has stood by them during the most destructive episode in their community life, the Tsunami of 2004, and has done pioneering work to help the community regain its normal functioning. Registered under XXI of 1860 societies Act- 393/1992, also having FCRA registration No. 010190227. The organization is exempted from Income Tax under Section 12A. The strength of the organisation is the staffs that have professionalism as well as commitment towards vulnerable communities, the recent support through Plan International (India) and CARE India emphasised on focusing on women and children with emphasis on rural development through promotion of sustainable livelihoods.

Participatory Forest Management CPF came into existence with its work on participatory forest management, which was initiated with involvement in the Joint Forest Management in 1996 when CPF was part of CWS. In Andhra Pradesh, CPF could reach out to 680 Vana Samrakshana Samithis (VSSs) belonging to 32 forest ranges in 12 districts of Andhra Pradesh through 32 local partner NGOs. These VSSs have 80,800 households and take care of 1.5 lakh ha of forest area in their charge. CPF through partner NGOs provided capacity building to these VSSs in microplan preparation, review and revision, Gender sensitisation and mainstreaming, resolution of various kinds of conflicts, facilitation skills to the partner NGO functionaries, policy and practice change processes, collaborations in livelihood enhancement, engagement with the forest department, community empowerment processes and mainstreaming concerns of HIV/AIDS. Recently, CPF has been involved in the Forest Rights Act 2006 both in providing inputs to the draft bill, rules etc and in the process of implementation. 2 Sustainable Livelihoods While working with the Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) on NTFP based livelihoods CPF started to understand the livelihood status of the members of VSSs in the CPF project area. CPFâ€™s initiatives on sustainable livelihoods to the forest dwelling and dependent communities fall in two broad categories, viz. forest produce based and land use based. A third category of finding alternative means to supplement the income is also attempted. Forest produce based interventions are i) Improving the service delivery of the Girijan Cooperative Corporation ii) Value addition to the Adda leaf iii) Sustainable extraction of wild honey As part of land use alternatives initiative, fodder generation and management was taken. Besides fodder development on the common lands, grazing lands earmarked for Panchayats were also reclaimed for fodder development in Mahabubnagar. Embroidery project was initiated with 30 Lambadi women of Narsapur forest range in Medak division. On the request of the Forest Department it was scaled up to five more divisions covering 225 women. 3 Policy Advocacy Significant results achieved by CPF by advocacy are : incorporation of recommendations of stakeholder consultations on CFM conducted by CPF, in the CFM GO and in the Project Implementation Plan of APCFM project, Changes in the R&R policy GO, withholding certain clauses from implementation with regard to the convergence GO (Velugu project), Circular for uniform implementation of CFM GO across the state, 100% returns from beedi leaf to collectors, Micro plan preparation, review of the status of implementation of CFM GO, benefit sharing with communities are some of the accomplishments at State level. At National level, CPF joined campaigns spearheaded by other agencies with regard to Biodiversity Act and Forest Rights Act 2006. It also spearheaded a campaign for the implementation of the Act. CPF has been informing the State level steering committees in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa on the same.","Hyderabad",9000005934,"iec@cpf.in","040-27154484","Centre for Peoples Forestry 12-13-483/39, Street No.14, Lane No.6, Nagarjunanagar Colony, Tarnaka, Secunderabad-500017","040-27154484","Disaster Management, Dalit Upliftment, Environment & Forests, HIV/AIDS, Rural Development & Poverty Alleviation, Tribal Affairs, Water Resources, Women's Development & Empowerment, Any Other",,,,,"http://www.cpf.in"

It believes that the success of this objective depends on the understanding of the aspirations of the poor. This requires the involvement and participation of the local people, and their representatives. Chetana is associated with the efforts of several individuals who have redeemed themselves in promoting the larger interests of the society. It has been working on environmental issues in Andhra Pradesh and in Hyderabad. In these campaigns, individuals from different walks of life are continuously supporting it: lawyers, doctors, academics, journalists, teachers, etc. It relies also on a strong network of youth, who are poised to set the direction of social change. Personnel presently associated with Chetana have been working on environment and development issues in Andhra Pradesh through various activities and initiatives. Due to them, this organization has enormous experience on issues of pollution and peopleâ€™s struggles associated with industrial pollution. It is dedicated to the concept of sustainable development. Chetana aims to motivate people to organize efforts, which promote environmental preservation, ecological conservation and alternative models of development. Chetana recognised the need to develop awareness and knowledge on agricultural issues for Indian farmers, especially women and disadvantaged sections. Farmers need to be exposed to wider issues, which would enable the Indian society to understand the changing scenarios and the range of choices being developed across the world. Most of the small and marginal farmers are not aware of the implications of policies and decisions, and also the fluctuations in the markets. Market knowledge of these sections has to be improved in order to empower them intellectually to respond to the need for their opinions and decisions. Similarly, it has been working on understanding the Textile chain of production, especially related to cotton. In this chain, Chetana is working on documenting information related to poor handloom weavers and develop a framework for their development. Over years, Chetana has defined its priorities in the following areas: Environmental Pollution and Urban problems Sustainable and equitable development Public Health Promotion of environment-friendly methods and technologies Chetana has also initiated a major programme on handloom sector, which has two distinct approaches: research and policy advocacy, and facilitating production by SHG-led weavers. Chetana has been working on information development and information dissemination on handloom weavers. It has brought out few publications related to women, budgets, cotton, markets, etc., including a regular newsletter. These publications are disseminated to the weavers, civil society and policy makers through workshops, meetings and directly. Chetana has also facilitated the formation of Self-Help Groups of weavers.
